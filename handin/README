Run Guide
**************************************
We provide three ways of testing the prototype. The recommanded way is to set up a running environment on local machine with virtual env or docker. The prototype is also deployed on the cloud and can be accessed through browser.

1. virtualenv

Make Sure "python 3.6" is successfully installed on your machine.

run "pip3 install virtualenv"
run "virtualenv env3"
copy the "site-packages" folder into "./env3/lib/python3.6/" and cover the original one
cd into env3 folder
run "source ./bin/activate"
cd into mysite
run "python3 manage.py runserver"
visit the prototype on localhost:8000

2. docker

Make Sure "docker" is successfully installed on your machine.

cd into the folder which contains the Dockerfile
run "docker build --rm --tag task6:latest ."
run "docker run -p 8000:8000 task6:latest"
visit the prototype on localhost:8000

3. cloud

The prototype can be visited on "ec2-54-86-74-206.compute-1.amazonaws.com"
